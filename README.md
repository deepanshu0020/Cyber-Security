#Project Overview
Security Operations Centres(SOCs) are reproving in identifying and reducing cyber threats. However the volume of incidents and wariness makes it more difficult for analysts to efficiently triage and respond. This project aims to amplify SOC efficiency by devolving a machine learning 
model to classify cybersecurity incidents from True Positive(TP), Benign Positive(BP), False Positive (FP) categories. By utilizing the GUIDE dataset, the model is designed to hold-up guided response systems, improving the all over security posture of enterprise environments.
